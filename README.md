### Typestore

TypeStore is a State Management library for no particular UI library.

This project is for learning purposes only and **shouldn't be used in production** (even though it's obvious I have to say it).

**How does it works?**

I don't know, I'm working on it ... just wait for it hehe

**How can I use this?**

First you have to:

`import { nothing } from 'unexistent-npm-package'`

Still don't have anything out hehe maybe in a month, or a week, or a day or so you can check this repo back :)

**Can I contribute?**

Sure, why not? But first wait a little longer so I have at least something stable :)

Crafted with :heart: for you!
